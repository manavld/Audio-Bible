# Introduction
I am Manav Lakhwani and im doing a research for my University project on how to create an Audio Bible document correctly when designing a game. 

## What is Audio Bible?
An Audio Bible is a document that containes the main audio clips and the general idea of how the sound is going to be in the videogame you are trying to develop. The objective is for the person reading it to understand how the sounds and music will be perfomed in every aspect of the game; the environment, the style, the genre, the character voice and animations, etc, and for that, the document must be very descriptive, specially as the audio is not already fully created. 

## How to create a good Audio Bible

### <i>Description</i>

Before starting anything, the first thing to do is to analyse the game itself, know its genre, the type of impact you want to give to the public and how you are going to do it. The objective is for the consumer to be as immersive as possible, so you dont want to add a suspense theme into an innocent animal pet game. With just the game pillars of a game you can already tell what type of audio you would be able to use and which of them not, inside the ones that can be used, you should evaluate what are the best options that will make a better immersion to improve the experience of the game in the eyes and ears of the player.

In this description you should implement this analysation on what type of style and genre of music and sounds that will be used, it is basically corresponding to the main setting of the game. This explanation will be reparted into 4 main points, **Music, Sounds, Dialogue and Animations**, where in each one of them there should be descriptive text on how these points will be reflected in the game in terms of style.

**Music** should have a short description of:
* <i>Genre:</i> As commented before, the genre should be involved in this description to indicate the appropiate type of music that will be involved in the game.
* <i>Style:</i>
