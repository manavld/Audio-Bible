# Introduction
I am Manav Lakhwani and im doing a research for my University project on how to create an Audio Bible document correctly when designing a game. 

## What is Audio Bible?
An Audio Bible is a document that containes the main audio clips and the general idea of how the sound is going to be in the videogame you are trying to develop. The objective is for the person reading it to understand how the sounds and music will be perfomed in every aspect of the game; the environment, the style, the genre, the character voice and animations, etc, and for that, the document must be very descriptive, specially as the audio is not already fully created.
