# Introduction
I am Manav Lakhwani and im doing a research for my University project on how to create an Audio Bible document correctly when designing a game. 

## What is Audio Bible?
An Audio Bible is a document that containes the main audio clips and the general idea of how the sound is going to be in the videogame you are trying to develop. The objective is for the person reading it to understand how the sounds and music will be perfomed in every aspect of the game; the environment, the style, the genre, the character voice and animations, etc, and for that, the document must be very descriptive, specially as the audio is not already fully created. 

## How to create a good Audio Bible

### <i>Description</i>

Before starting anything, the first thing to do is to analyse the game itself, know its genre, the type of impact you want to give to the public and how you are going to do it. The objective is for the consumer to be as immersive as possible, so you dont want to add a suspense theme into an innocent animal pet game. With just the game pillars of a game you can already tell what type of audio you would be able to use and which of them not, inside the ones that can be used, you should evaluate what are the best options that will make a better immersion to improve the experience of the game in the eyes and ears of the player.

In this description you should implement this analysation on what type of style and genre of music and sounds that will be used, it is basically corresponding to the main setting of the game. This explanation will be reparted into 4 main points, **Sounds, Music, Dialogue and Animations**, where in each one of them there should be descriptive text on how these points will be reflected in the game in terms of style.

**Sound** should have a short description of:
* <i>Ambience:</i> The type of environment sound the game has, this normally is a regular sound during the whole game (rain sounds, blinking lights in a scary room, etc), basically the general sound there is in the surroundings. This is important as the player has to feel like he is in that environment, there can not be a very high sound of big waves when in the screen you can see its just a calm day at the beach. Every aspect of the environment matters, so a good description is needed to understand the feeling you want to give to the consumer.
* <i>Main Character:</i> This is for the main character or characters, it is really important that the consumer feels like he/she is the main character, immersion in this aspect is essential. For that, it is important to understand who your main character is and represent exactly that through the sound it makes. The voices it makes, grunting, movement and especially, footsteps. Footsteps are much more important in videogames that it seems, as the player is going to control and move the character around for a long amount of time. With all these sounds you should be able to tell some aspects of the character, giving for example the feeling of heaviness or lightness on them (by the footsteps and movement or jumping sounds).
* <i>Enemies:</i> The same thing goes for the enemies and other characters, but as the focus of the game does not go on them, these will appear and disappear during the game. So, apart from the basic sounds that the enemies would have in the scene and give them a special sound to them so you can identify them by their sound, the aspect of surround sound comes into place. Surround sound is when you hear an enemy coming through one side and you hear him in that side of your headphones, depending on your game this will be very important (for example shooters).
* <i>Dynamic Range:</i> This explains how big of an impact you want the sound to be for your game (for example sound is extremely important when it comes to scary games).

**Music** should have a short description of:
* <i>Genre:</i> As commented before, the genre should be involved in this description to indicate the appropiate type of music that will be involved in the game.
* <i>Style:</i> The type of music in terms of multiple amounts of sounds at once to make a feeling of chaos, or small slow music to add suspense, tension or calmness.
* <i>Implementation:</i> The time when certain music will be used, whether if there is a same minimum music during the whole game, when just one character appears, when something is completed, etc.
* <i>Instrumentation:</i> The instruments that are going to be used to produce the music.
* <i>Recording:</i> How and where will the music be recorded to assure a good sound production. 
* <i>Dynamic Range:</i> This is the "flow" of the game music, sometimes complete moments of silence help to the experience of the game (to add suspense for example), but it is important to find the right time to use that.

**Dialogue** should have a short description of:
* <i>Style:</i> The way the dialogue is going to be represented (cinematics, voice-over, etc).
* <i>Types:</i> The type of voices you will need to create these sounds (a deep angry voice for an enemy for example).
* <i>Dynamic Range:</i> The way you plan to control the dialogue over the music/sounds that are being played, or if you plan to stop them to add importance to the dialogue.

**Animations** should have a short description of:
* <i>Weapons and Items of the Player:</i> Depending on what weapons and/or items the characters have, there should be a brief description on how the animations would sound when they are in use.
* <i>FX:</i> The type of effects, according to the visuals, that there will be and the style that are going to be made of (for example explosions or lasers).
